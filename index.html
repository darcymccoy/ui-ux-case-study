            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            This is my SOEN 357 mini project hosted on GitHub pages.

            <h2>Research &amp; Analysis</h2>

            <h3>User Survey</h3>
            The methods that I would use to gather information on my users’ needs are as follows:
I would conduct a survey to see what users’ find frustrating about the traditional chronic health condition management solutions. Unfortunately, I did not know enough people with chronic health conditions to conduct these surveys in reality. Instead of gathering information, I conducted research on the internet. Additionally, I would include a form inside my app to allow users’ to provide feedback on issues and possible enhancements.

            <h3>Online Research</h3>
            According to <a href="https://www.onrec.com/news/news-archive/keeping-role-of-basic-healthcare-apps-in">onrec.com</a>, the “best healthcare apps solve small daily problems.” This mindset was especially important to me while crafting my mobile app solution. I did not attempt to replace traditional health care solutions, rather compliment them and provide better care for those with chronic health conditions.

            <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
            My goals are to improve the app and its services. The user tasks are the following: create a new reminder, schedule a doctor appointment, contact a doctor or other medical professional by text and finally, view prescription information. I would collect feedback by watching users' interactions with the prototype and by interviewing users after the test. I would take that feedback and use it to iteratively improve the application. This iterative approach would include fixing issues and conducting more usability testing afterwards.

            <h2>Reflection and Conclusion</h2>
            This UX design process helped me identify user needs by allowing me to conduct my own research and build my own product. Through this process I saw the challenges that users might have with all sorts of mobile apps. Plus I gained hands-on experience with user interface/experience tools. One of my challenges was that I did not know enough people to interview for this project. The other challenges I experienced during the design process were almost all derived from a lack of experience using user experience design tools. I had never used Figma at all before and I had only a small amount of experience with Lucid and Canva.
